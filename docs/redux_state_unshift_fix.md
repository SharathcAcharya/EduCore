# Redux State Error Fix: sentMessages.unshift is not a function

## Issue Description

The messaging system was failing with the error:

```
Error sending message: TypeError: state.sentMessages.unshift is not a function
```

This error occurred in the message reducer when trying to add a new message to the sent messages list, but `state.sentMessages` was not an array as expected.

## Root Cause

1. When the API returns an empty inbox or sent messages, it was returning an object with a message property: `{ message: "No messages found" }` or `{ message: "No sent messages found" }` instead of an empty array `[]`.

2. The Redux slice's reducers didn't check if sentMessages was an array before calling array methods like `unshift()`.

3. The school ID handling in the message creation process was inconsistent and could lead to improperly formatted IDs.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend API Consistency

Updated backend controller functions to always return arrays for message lists, even when empty:

- `getInbox`: Now always returns an array, never an object with a message property
- `getSentMessages`: Now always returns an array, never an object with a message property

### 2. Redux State Management

Updated the Redux message slice to ensure state properties are always of the expected type:

- Added checks to ensure `state.sentMessages` is always an array before using array methods
- Added validation in `getSentMessagesSuccess` to ensure it always saves an array to state
- Added similar checks for inbox and message detail reducers

### 3. Improved Error Handling

Enhanced error handling throughout the message system:

- Better serialization of errors for consistent UI feedback
- Improved validation of message data before sending
- Better handling of different ID formats (string vs object)

### 4. Student Message UI Improvements

Enhanced the student message sending functionality:

- Better school ID extraction and validation
- Improved UX by clearing the message input early and restoring it on failure
- More detailed error messages to help troubleshoot issues

## Testing

This fix has been tested with the following scenarios:

1. Sending messages when sent messages list is empty
2. Sending messages after retrieving an empty inbox
3. Handling various school ID formats correctly
4. Properly handling error conditions

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Ensure all API endpoints return consistent data structures
2. Always validate state types before using type-specific methods
3. Implement comprehensive error handling with detailed logs
4. Handle different ID formats consistently across the application
