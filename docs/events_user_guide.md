2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Include all necessary information in the description
3. **Accurate Dates**: Set precise start and end dates/times for events
4. **Proper Categorization**: Choose the appropriate event type
5. **Class Specification**: For admin users, always specify the target class when the event isn't school-wide
6. **Regular Updates**: Keep the event calendar current by updating or removing past or canceled events
